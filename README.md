## 🚀 Project Overview
  Welcome to the TellCo initiative for Investment Analysis! I go on a financial investigation and strategic decision-making journey for a wealthy investor who specializes in buying assets at a discount in this collection. The Republic of Pefkakia's TellCo, an established mobile service provider, is the subject of my analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
  1. **Data Exploration:** Discover important information regarding consumer behavior, network activity, and financial performance by delving deeply into TellCo's telecom dataset.
  2. **Identify Growth Opportunities:** Analyze TellCo's underutilized services, client preferences, and patterns to identify possible expansion routes.
  3. **Dashboard and Report Creation:** Create a user-friendly web dashboard with a visual representation of the retrieved insights. Concurrently, compose an extensive written report that offers the investor a thorough summary of TellCo's present situation as well as its future prospects.
